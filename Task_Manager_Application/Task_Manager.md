This is a very efficient and easy to use application with so many advantages. But it has many limitations that can be addressed. Sometimes the tasks may not be so convinient to see. The user might have to scroll up to view their tasks. This limitation can be solved by integrating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) into this application
